To display the shield security image in the Hero component, please:

1. Upload a high-quality security shield logo image with these specifications:
   - Minimal and geometric in design
   - Clean, modern look with a purple/blue color scheme
   - 3D or flat design shield with technological elements
   - No text or complex details
   - Transparent background (PNG format)
   - At least 500x500px, ideally 1000x1000px

2. After uploading, rename it to "shield-security.png" and ensure it's placed in the public/lovable-uploads/ directory.

Alternative: If you can't upload a custom image, you can use this placeholder in Hero.tsx:

```jsx
<div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-primary/10 rounded-2xl">
  <Shield className="w-32 h-32 text-primary opacity-80" />
</div>
```
